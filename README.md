## Code Challenges with CSS

- [x] The "body" has to have a height of 1500px;
- [x] The top red bar should stay at the top of the page even if I scroll.
- [x] The white title should have a 50px space from the borders of the blue box.
- [x] The yellow box should have a grey border.
- [x] There should be one .css file and one .html file.
- [x] The green box should be in the intersection between the red, blue and yellow.


### Tips

- div , section , h1 , header... are blocks by default.
- a , span .. are inlines by default.
- Display:inline does not take the box properties (height, width, etc) into account.
- Display:inline-block allows elements next to it plus box properties like width and height.
- Properties top,bottom,left,right don't work on static elements.
- Position:absolute looks for the closest 'relative' parent 
- If there is no 'relative' parent, 'absolute' boxes align to the body tag.
